Scientific Calculator
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It provides the structure for web content by using a system of tags and elements. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style the HTML elements, controlling their appearance and layout.

To create a scientific calculator using HTML and CSS, you'll typically start by structuring the calculator's layout using HTML elements such as <div>, <input>, and <button>. These elements will define the various parts of the calculator, including the display screen, numeric keys, mathematical operations, etc.
